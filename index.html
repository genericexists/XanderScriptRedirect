        <h2>Notice of Script Deprecation</h2>
        <p>To whom it may concern,</p>
        <p>Effective immediately, all scripts developed by generic and Ducklife made for Xander/his friends are being deprecated and will no longer be maintained or supported. This decision follows our recent ban from Xander's server, which we believe was unjust. <br><br>Ducklife was removed simply because he owned a server where Epicmines was present, and generic was banned merely for being a member of Ducklife's server that included Epicmines. This action appears arbitrary, especially given that many members in Xander's servers, an example being Doggo LIVE, often take Xander's words as law, and because of this, Xander believes we will always abide by what he says (similar to what many others do) without question due to him having experience with people doing such.  We do not adhere to such beliefs. :)</p>
        <p>Despite our previous willingness to contribute, we refuse to ban Epicmines from Ducklife's server. The ban on generic and Ducklife simply because of Epicmines is unjust, especially due to Ducklife and Epicmines having no recent interaction. The last conversation Ducklife and Epicmines had was a few months ago, and it revolved solely around Blooket and nothing more. <br><br>In light of these events, we have decided to cease script development for Xander. <br><br>Ducklife wishes to emphasize his acceptance of the situation and notes the impact on antibots for Gimkit/Blooket, now in a state of disrepair without maintenance.</p><p>And before you come saying "Epicmines did this, Epicmines did that!" We know already. He is staying in our server anyways.<p>
        <p>We appreciate the support of our users and collaborators during this transition. Should circumstances change and we are unbanned, we will probably not resume script development for Xander regardless.</p>

            <p>Thank you. Message written by generic, used by us both.</p>
